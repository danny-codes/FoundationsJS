# FoundationsJS

This repository contains my solutions and exercises from the **JavaScript Foundations** course of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript-foundations). It's a collection of various JavaScript exercises aimed at building foundational skills for web development.

### About this Repository:
- **Learning Focus:** Basics of JavaScript, DOM manipulation, arrays, loops, functions, conditionals, clean code practices, and more.
- **Exercises:** Each folder in this repo represents a different topic or exercise that I worked through as part of the course.

### Contents:
1. **DOM-manipulation-&-events**: Examples of working with the DOM and handling events.
2. **arrays-and-loops**: Exercises covering arrays and loops in JavaScript.
3. **clean-code**: Applying clean code principles in JavaScript.
4. **data-types-&-conditionals**: Working with different data types and conditionals.
5. **function-basics**: Functions, arguments, and return values in JavaScript.
6. **js-dev-tools**: Debugging and using development tools.
7. **problem-solving**: Problem-solving techniques using JavaScript.
8. **rock-paper-scissors**: A simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game built in JavaScript.

### Purpose:
This project is my personal practice as I work through the foundational topics in JavaScript. The goal is to solidify my understanding of the concepts, improve my coding skills, and eventually tackle more complex projects.
