# FoundationsJS

This repository contains my solutions and exercises from the **JavaScript Foundations** course of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#javascript-basics). It's a collection of various JavaScript exercises aimed at building foundational skills for web development.

### About this Repository:
- **Learning Focus:** Basics of JavaScript, DOM manipulation, arrays, loops, functions, conditionals, clean code practices, and object basics.
- **Exercises:** Each folder in this repo represents a different topic or exercise that I worked through as part of the course.
